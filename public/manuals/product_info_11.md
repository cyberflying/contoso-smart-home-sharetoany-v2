## Cautions
1. **Liquid Avoidance**: Do not use the vacuum to clean liquids or wet areas.
2. **Stair Safety**: The vacuum has anti-fall sensors, but always place physical barriers near dangerous drops if sensors might be compromised (e.g., by dark flooring).
3. **Pet Considerations**: Remove fragile items and pet toys before scheduled cleanings.
4. **Direct Sunlight**: Avoid positioning the charging dock in direct sunlight, which can interfere with the vacuum's return navigation.
5. **Battery Care**: For extended storage, charge the battery fully and power off the vacuum completely.
6. **Filter Maintenance**: Always ensure filters are completely dry before reinstalling to prevent mold growth.
7. **No Outdoor Use**: This vacuum is designed for indoor use only.
8. **Small Objects**: Pick up small objects that could jam the brush system.
9. **Surface Compatibility**: Not suitable for high-pile carpet (>1.5 inches) or very dark surfaces that might confuse sensors.
10. **Moving Care**: When transporting the vacuum between floors, carry it rather than dragging or rolling it.

## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This vacuum has completely changed my cleaning routine! The mapping technology is incredibly accurate - it created a perfect layout of my home after just one cleaning. I love being able to select specific rooms to clean when I'm short on time. The suction power is impressive even on my thick area rugs, and it handles pet hair with ease.

2) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After trying several robot vacuums, this is by far the most intelligent. It navigates around furniture gracefully instead of bumping into everything like my previous models. The app is intuitive and the scheduling feature works flawlessly. Battery life is excellent - it cleans my entire 1800 sq ft home on one charge with battery to spare!

3) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Very impressed with the cleaning performance and smart features. The virtual boundaries work perfectly for keeping it away from pet food bowls and delicate items. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it occasionally struggles with the transition from hardwood to a particularly thick rug in my living room.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As someone with allergies, I appreciate the HEPA filtration system - I've noticed a significant reduction in dust since using this vacuum daily. The edge cleaning feature is exceptional, getting into corners better than any robot vacuum I've owned before. The slim design allows it to clean under furniture my previous vacuum couldn't reach.

5) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** The integration with my other Meowtica devices makes this vacuum incredibly convenient. I've set up routines so when I leave the house, it automatically starts cleaning. When I say "Hey Meowtica, time to clean," the vacuum starts while my smart lights adjust for optimal navigation. Worth every penny for the time it saves me!

## FAQ
1) How often should I replace the filters and brushes?
   We recommend replacing the HEPA filter every 2-3 months with regular use. Side brushes should be replaced every 3-6 months, and the main roller brush every 6-12 months depending on use. More frequent replacement may be necessary in homes with pets or high dust levels.

2) Can the vacuum clean in the dark?
   While the vacuum can operate in low light conditions, it works best with some ambient lighting. Complete darkness may affect the accuracy of its navigation system and mapping capabilities.

3) How do I reset the map if I move furniture or renovate a room?
   In the Meowtica app, go to Map Management and select "Reset Map." The next time the vacuum performs a complete cleaning cycle, it will create a new map of your space.

4) Does the vacuum work on multiple floors of a home?
   Yes, the Smart Vacuum can store up to 4 different floor maps. When moved to a different level, it will recognize the change and use the appropriate map, or create a new one if it's the first time on that floor.

5) How does the vacuum handle pet waste accidents?
   The vacuum is not designed to clean pet waste. If there's a possibility of pet accidents, we recommend checking floors before scheduled cleanings or using virtual boundaries around areas where accidents commonly occur.
