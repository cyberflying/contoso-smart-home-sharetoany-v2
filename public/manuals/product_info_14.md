## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This robot mop has been a game-changer for my tile floors! The mapping is incredibly accurate - it recognized my home layout on the first run and now navigates flawlessly. I love that I can set different water levels for different rooms (more water for the kitchen, less for the entryway). The app is intuitive and the scheduling feature means I wake up to clean floors every day.

2) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After trying several robot mops, this one is by far the best. The LiDAR navigation means it cleans in efficient rows rather than bumping around randomly like my previous model. It's surprisingly thorough along edges and corners. Battery life is excellent - it can mop my entire 1800 sq ft first floor on a single charge. The virtual boundaries feature is perfect for keeping it away from area rugs.

3) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Very impressed with the cleaning performance and smart features. The mapping technology is accurate and I appreciate being able to label different rooms in the app. The water control system distributes just the right amount of moisture without leaving the floors too wet. My only complaint is that it sometimes has trouble finding its way back to the dock if moved during cleaning.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As someone with three kids and two dogs, this robot mop has been life-changing! I run it daily and my floors have never been cleaner. The app notifications are helpful, and I love being able to start a cleaning cycle remotely when the kids text that they've spilled something. The mop pads are high quality and still look great after multiple washings.

5) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** The precision of this robot mop is impressive! It meticulously cleans along furniture legs and in tight spaces that I struggle to reach manually. The multi-floor mapping is perfect for our two-story home. I especially appreciate how quiet it is - I can run it during work calls without any disruption. Worth every penny for the time it saves me!

## FAQ
1) Can I use cleaning solutions with the Smart Robot Mop?
   You can use Meowtica-approved cleaning solutions specifically designed for robot mops. Standard cleaning solutions may damage the internal mechanisms or leave residue that affects performance. For most cleaning needs, distilled water is sufficient, but if you want to use a cleaning solution, please check our website for compatible products or purchase our specially formulated Meowtica Floor Cleaning Solution.

2) How often should I replace the mop pads?
   With regular maintenance (rinsing after each use and machine washing weekly), the microfiber mop pads typically last 3-6 months depending on usage frequency and floor conditions. Signs that it's time to replace include fraying edges, staining that doesn't wash out, reduced absorption capability, or diminished cleaning performance. We recommend keeping a spare set of mop pads on hand.

3) Can the robot mop clean multiple rooms in one cycle?
   Yes, after the initial mapping process, the Smart Robot Mop can clean multiple rooms in a single cleaning cycle. You can prioritize rooms, set cleaning sequences, or exclude specific areas using the app. The robot will automatically navigate between rooms and can clean up to 2000 square feet on a single charge. If the battery runs low during cleaning, it will return to the dock, recharge, and then resume where it left off.

4) Is the Smart Robot Mop safe for all floor types?
   The Smart Robot Mop is designed for sealed hard flooring surfaces including tile, vinyl, laminate, marble, and sealed hardwood. It is not suitable for carpet, rugs, unsealed wood, or highly waxed/polished floors. For engineered hardwood or other delicate flooring, use the lowest water setting. Always check your flooring manufacturer's recommendations regarding water cleaning before use.

5) How does the Smart Robot Mop handle obstacles and stairs?
   The Smart Robot Mop uses advanced LiDAR sensors to detect and navigate around obstacles such as furniture, pet bowls, and toys. The cliff sensors prevent it from falling down stairs or steep drops. For very low furniture (less than 3.5 inches clearance), the robot may not be able to clean underneath. You can set virtual "no-go zones" in the app for areas you want the robot to avoid completely.
