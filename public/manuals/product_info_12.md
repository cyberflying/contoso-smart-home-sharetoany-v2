## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This collar has been a game-changer for our anxious rescue dog! She's a bit of an escape artist, but now we get instant notifications if she leaves our yard. The tracking is incredibly accurate - we can see exactly which neighbor's yard she's visiting. The battery life is impressive too, lasting almost the full 7 days even with frequent location checks.

2) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As someone with an indoor/outdoor cat, this gives me such peace of mind. I've created safe zones around our house and get alerts if he wanders too far. The activity tracking has been eye-opening - turns out my "lazy" cat walks nearly 2 miles every night! The collar is surprisingly light, and he adjusted to it within a day.

3) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Very impressed with the accuracy and features. The app is intuitive, and I love being able to see where my dog has been during our dog walker visits. The LED light is bright enough for evening walks. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the battery drains more quickly than advertised when in areas with spotty cellular coverage.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** Worth every penny for the peace of mind! Our dog bolted after a squirrel during a camping trip, and we were able to locate him within minutes using the real-time tracking. The collar has held up amazingly well through lake swimming, mud puddles, and rough play with other dogs. The health monitoring features have also helped us establish better exercise routines.

5) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After losing our previous cat for three terrifying days, we invested in this collar for our new kitten. The geofencing feature works perfectly, and the Bluetooth proximity alert lets us know when she's near but hiding somewhere in the house. The subscription cost is reasonable considering the technology and peace of mind it provides.

## FAQ
1) Does the Track Collar require a subscription plan?
   Yes, a subscription is required for GPS tracking and cellular connectivity features. The first 3 months are included with purchase. After that, you can choose between monthly ($4.99/month) or annual ($49.99/year) plans. Basic Bluetooth proximity features will work without a subscription.

2) How accurate is the location tracking?
   Outdoors with clear sky visibility, the GPS tracking is accurate within approximately 10 feet. In dense urban areas or indoors, accuracy may decrease to 30-100 feet depending on WiFi and cellular signal strength. The Bluetooth proximity feature works within about 100 feet line-of-sight.

3) Is the collar safe to wear while my pet is swimming?
   Yes, the collar is rated IP67 waterproof, meaning it can withstand submersion in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes. It's perfectly safe for swimming, bath time, and rainy days. However, salt water exposure should be followed by a rinse in fresh water.

4) How long does the battery last?
   With default settings, the battery typically lasts 5-7 days between charges. Battery life varies based on usage factors including tracking frequency, cellular signal strength, temperature, and feature usage. Using the power-saving mode can extend battery life by up to 30%.

5) Can I track multiple pets in the same app?
   Yes, you can add multiple Track Collars to your Meowtica app and track all your pets from a single interface. Each collar requires its own subscription, but family subscription discounts are available for households with multiple pets.
