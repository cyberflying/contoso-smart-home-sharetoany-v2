## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** These smart plugs have simplified my daily routine! I have them connected to my coffee maker and living room lamps, and now they turn on automatically each morning. The energy monitoring feature was eye-opening - I had no idea my old TV used so much power in standby mode. Setup took less than 2 minutes per plug.

2) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** Compact design is perfect for my crowded power strip - doesn't block adjacent outlets like other smart plugs I've tried. The app is intuitive, and I love the ability to group multiple plugs together. Now I can say "Hey Meowtica, movie time" and all my entertainment system devices power on at once.

3) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Works exactly as described, and the energy monitoring is a great bonus feature. I've had these for about 3 months without any disconnection issues. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the app sometimes takes a few seconds to update the status after manually pressing the button on the plug.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** The away mode feature gives me peace of mind when traveling. My lights turn on and off randomly in the evenings, making it look like someone's home. The countdown timer is perfect for my space heater - it automatically shuts off after 2 hours so I never worry about leaving it on accidentally.

5) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** I started with one of these plugs and now have six throughout my home. The scheduling is reliable and the energy monitoring has helped me identify power-hungry appliances. Integration with the Meowtica hub was seamless, and voice control works flawlessly. Highly recommended!
