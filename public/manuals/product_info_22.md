## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This smart power strip has completely transformed my home office setup. The individual outlet control is perfect for my workflow - I've programmed my coffee maker to turn on with my morning alarm, my desk lamp to turn off at sunset, and my computer peripherals to power down after work hours. The energy monitoring feature was eye-opening - I discovered my printer was drawing significant standby power, so now I have it automatically turn off completely when not in use. The surge protection gives me peace of mind during storm season, and the compact design fits perfectly behind my desk without taking up much space.

2) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As a home theater enthusiast, this power strip is exactly what I needed. I've connected my TV, soundbar, gaming console, and streaming box to the individually controlled outlets, while using the always-on USB ports for my phone charger and ambient lighting. The ability to create "scenes" is fantastic - one command turns on everything needed for movie night, while another activates just the gaming setup. The energy monitoring helped me realize just how much electricity my old receiver was wasting, which justified upgrading to a more efficient model. Construction quality is excellent, and the app interface is intuitive and responsive.

3) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** The WhiskerControl power strip delivers on its promises with excellent functionality. The energy monitoring is impressively accurate - I verified it against my dedicated power meter and found it to be within 1% tolerance. Setting up schedules for my kitchen appliances has actually helped reduce our electricity bill. My only minor complaint is that the physical buttons require a firm press to activate, which can be challenging if you have the strip in a tight space. The app interface makes up for this with its intuitive design and reliable performance.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This smart power strip is a game changer for anyone with lots of electronic devices. I use it in my craft room to power my sewing machine, iron, cutting machine, and lamp - each with their own schedules and automation. The safety features have already proven their worth when my iron pulled too much current; the strip shut down automatically and sent me an alert. I particularly appreciate how the app provides usage statistics, showing me which tools consume the most power. The voice control integration works flawlessly with my existing smart home system, allowing me to power specific devices without interrupting my workflow.

5) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After trying several smart power strips, the WhiskerControl is by far the best. The standout feature is the power monitoring accuracy, which helped me identify several energy vampires in my entertainment system. The build quality is substantially better than cheaper alternatives - solid construction with high-quality outlets that grip plugs securely. I originally bought one for my home office but have since purchased three more for different areas of the house. The ability to create outlet groups across multiple power strips is incredibly useful for whole-house automation routines. Worth every penny for the reliability and features.

## FAQ
1) Can I control individual outlets when I'm away from home?
   Yes, the WhiskerControl Smart Power Strip offers full remote access to all features when you're away from home, provided your home has an active internet connection. You can turn individual outlets on or off, monitor real-time power consumption, adjust schedules, and receive notifications through the Meowtica app from anywhere in the world. For enhanced security, remote access uses encrypted communications and requires account authentication. If you prefer, you can disable remote access through the app's security settings. Additionally, the "Away Mode" feature can automatically simulate occupancy by turning selected outlets on and off at randomized intervals while you're gone.

2) How accurate is the energy monitoring feature?
   The WhiskerControl Smart Power Strip features precision energy monitoring with ±1% accuracy for devices drawing more than 5W of power. It measures voltage, current, power (watts), and energy consumption (kWh) in real-time, with readings updated every 10 seconds. The system can detect power usage as low as 0.1W, though accuracy is slightly reduced below 5W. The app displays current consumption and accumulates historical data, which you can view as hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly charts. You can also input your electricity rate to convert energy usage into cost estimates, helping you identify potential savings. For advanced users, all energy data can be exported in CSV format for detailed analysis.

3) What happens if there's a power outage or Wi-Fi interruption?
   During a power outage, the WhiskerControl Smart Power Strip will, of course, lose power. When electricity is restored, the power strip will automatically reboot and restore all outlets to their pre-outage states (on or off) based on locally stored settings. If Wi-Fi is unavailable when power returns, the strip will operate according to its last received settings and continue attempting to reconnect to your network in the background. All programmed schedules are stored locally on the device and will continue to function even during temporary Wi-Fi outages. Once internet connectivity is restored, the power strip will automatically reconnect to the Meowtica cloud and synchronize any missed status updates or new settings changes from the app.

4) Can I integrate this power strip with my existing smart home system?
   The WhiskerControl Smart Power Strip integrates seamlessly with the Meowtica ecosystem and supports connections to major third-party smart home platforms. It works natively with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit (through the Meowtica Hub), allowing for voice control and inclusion in multi-brand automation routines. For more advanced users, the strip supports IFTTT for creating custom automation triggers with services and devices outside the major ecosystems. Additionally, the Meowtica API is available for developers who wish to create custom integrations. If you're using Samsung SmartThings, Hubitat, or Home Assistant, community-developed integrations are available through those platforms' respective marketplaces.

5) Is there any limit to how many devices I can monitor and control with the app?
   The Meowtica app can manage and monitor an unlimited number of WhiskerControl Smart Power Strips within a single household account. Each power strip appears as a separate device with its individual outlets displayed for control. You can organize multiple power strips by room, create custom groups across different strips, and even manage strips in different locations (such as home and office) from the same app. For households with multiple family members, you can share access with up to 10 users, each with their own account and customizable permissions. The app's dashboard efficiently handles large setups, and you can create favorites for quick access to frequently used outlets. The only practical limitation is your home network's capacity to handle multiple connected devices.
