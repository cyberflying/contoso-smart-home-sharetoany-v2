## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This air purifier has been life-changing for my allergies! I can literally feel the difference in air quality within an hour of turning it on. The auto mode is incredibly responsive - when I'm cooking, it immediately increases speed to handle the smoke and odors. The app gives fascinating insights into my home's air quality throughout the day.

2) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As someone with asthma and a pet cat, this was a necessary investment. The real-time air quality monitoring gives me peace of mind, and I love being able to turn it on remotely before coming home. The sleep mode is truly silent - I forget it's even running. Worth every penny for the health benefits alone!

3) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Very effective at removing odors and improving air quality. The design is sleek and doesn't look out of place in my modern living room. The app is intuitive and the scheduling feature works perfectly. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the highest fan speed is a bit louder than I expected.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After moving to a city apartment near a busy street, I was concerned about pollution. This purifier has made a noticeable difference - less dust on surfaces and I'm sleeping better. The voice control through my Meowtica hub is convenient, and I appreciate the honest filter replacement indicators that seem to be based on actual use rather than just time.

5) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** We bought this primarily for wildfire season, but it's become an essential household appliance year-round. The air quality readings correlate perfectly with local air quality reports. It's powerful enough for our open-concept living area, and the energy usage is surprisingly low even when running continuously.

## FAQ
1) How often should I replace the filters?
   The HEPA and activated carbon filters typically need replacement every 6-12 months, depending on usage and air quality conditions. The app will provide specific replacement notifications based on actual use rather than just time elapsed. Filter life is shorter in environments with higher pollution, smoke, pet dander, or dust levels.

2) Does the air purifier remove viruses and bacteria?
   The H13 True HEPA filter captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, which includes many bacteria and virus carriers. While it significantly reduces airborne pathogens, it should be considered one part of a comprehensive approach to indoor air quality and health.

3) How much area can one purifier effectively clean?
   This model is rated for rooms up to 800 square feet with standard ceiling heights. For optimal performance in larger spaces, we recommend using multiple units or selecting areas of highest priority (bedrooms, living areas). In smaller rooms, the air will be cleaned more quickly.

4) Will the air purifier remove pet odors and dander?
   Yes, the combination of HEPA filtration and activated carbon is highly effective for both pet dander (which can trigger allergies) and pet odors. For homes with multiple pets or strong odors, more frequent filter replacement may be necessary.

5) Can I use the air purifier 24/7?
   Yes, the air purifier is designed for continuous operation. The energy-efficient design means it uses minimal electricity, especially in Auto mode which adjusts fan speed based on air quality. Many users choose to run it continuously for consistent air quality.
