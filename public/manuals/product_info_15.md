## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** I purchased several of these sensors for my home, placing them in different rooms to monitor temperature variations. The accuracy is impressive - I verified against a scientific thermometer and it was within 0.4 degrees! The historical data has helped me identify that my west-facing rooms heat up significantly in the afternoon, allowing me to program my smart thermostat zones more efficiently. Battery life is excellent too - running for 8 months so far without replacement.

2) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Great little sensor that has been instrumental in monitoring the humidity in my basement. The alerts saved us from potential mold issues by notifying us when humidity spiked after heavy rainfall. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish the sampling rate could be increased to every minute instead of every 5 minutes for more granular data. Otherwise, connectivity is rock solid and the design is unobtrusive.

3) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As a wine collector, maintaining proper temperature and humidity in my cellar is crucial. This sensor provides peace of mind with reliable monitoring and instant alerts if conditions change. The historical tracking helps me ensure my collection is stored under optimal conditions year-round. The app interface is intuitive and setup took less than 5 minutes. Highly recommend for any specialized environment monitoring!

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** Perfect for monitoring my baby's nursery! I can check the temperature and humidity levels without entering the room and disturbing sleep. The app is easy to use and the alerts are customizable. I've connected it to automatically adjust our smart thermostat if the room gets too cold at night. Battery has lasted over 10 months with daily use. Worth every penny for the peace of mind it provides.

5) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** These sensors work great for my greenhouse monitoring. The readings are consistent and the range is impressive - my greenhouse is about 200 feet from the house and it still connects reliably. I've found the humidity readings to be particularly useful for maintaining proper growing conditions. My only complaint is that the mounting bracket could be more versatile for greenhouse applications, but I solved this with a small 3D-printed adapter.

## FAQ
1) How accurate is the Purr Temperature Sensor?
   The Purr Temperature Sensor provides temperature readings accurate to ±0.5°F (±0.3°C) and humidity readings accurate to ±3% relative humidity. These specifications are maintained throughout the sensor's operating range of -4°F to 140°F (-20°C to 60°C). For maximum accuracy, the sensor should be placed away from direct heat/cooling sources, sunlight, and areas with poor air circulation.

2) How many Purr Temperature Sensors can I add to my Meowtica system?
   The Meowtica system supports up to 32 temperature sensors per hub. This allows comprehensive monitoring throughout larger homes, multiple floors, or specialized environments. Each sensor appears as a separate device in your Meowtica app, and they can be organized into rooms or zones for easier management. Multiple users can access the readings through shared account access.

3) Can I export the historical temperature and humidity data?
   Yes, the Meowtica app allows you to export sensor data in CSV format for further analysis. You can select custom date ranges and export hourly, daily, or weekly averages. This feature is particularly useful for scientific applications, climate analysis, or documentation requirements. Premium users can also set up automated weekly or monthly data exports delivered directly to their email.

4) Will this work without a Meowtica Smart Hub?
   The Purr Temperature Sensor requires either a Meowtica Smart Hub, Paws Mini Smart Hub, or WhiskerNet Pro Hub to connect to your home network and the Meowtica cloud. However, initial setup can be performed via Bluetooth directly to your smartphone. Once paired with a hub, the sensor will transmit data even when your smartphone is not present, ensuring continuous monitoring and alerting.

5) Can I integrate the temperature readings with other smart home systems?
   Yes, temperature and humidity readings from the Purr Temperature Sensor can trigger actions in compatible smart home devices through the Meowtica ecosystem. Common integrations include adjusting smart thermostats, activating fans or dehumidifiers, and sending notifications. The sensor is also compatible with major third-party platforms through the Meowtica integration API, allowing advanced users to create custom automations.
