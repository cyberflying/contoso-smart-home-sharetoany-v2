## Cautions
1. **Electrical Safety**: Always turn off power at the circuit breaker before installation or maintenance.
2. **Installation Requirements**: Fixture must be installed in a compatible electrical box rated for ceiling fixtures.
3. **Weight Capacity**: Ensure your electrical box can support the weight of the fixture (approximately 2.2 lbs).
4. **Dimmer Compatibility**: Only use with smart dimming through the app; not compatible with traditional wall dimmers.
5. **Wet Locations**: Not rated for wet locations like shower areas; suitable for damp locations like bathrooms with proper ventilation.
6. **Enclosed Fixtures**: Designed for open air circulation; do not install in fully enclosed fixtures as this may cause overheating.
7. **Bulb Replacement**: LED array is integrated and not replaceable; the entire fixture would need replacement at end of lifespan.
8. **Operating Voltage**: Connect only to specified voltage (120V AC) to prevent damage or fire hazard.
9. **Network Requirements**: Requires stable 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network for smart features.
10. **Heat Considerations**: Maintain clearance from insulation and combustible materials in attic or ceiling space.

## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This ceiling light has completely transformed our home office. The ability to adjust from warm to cool white has been a game-changer for productivity - I use cooler light during work hours and switch to warm light in the evening. The app is intuitive, and scheduling features work flawlessly. Installation was straightforward, taking less than 30 minutes. The light itself has a clean, modern design that looks much more expensive than its price point. Most importantly, the light distribution is even with no harsh shadows.

2) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Great smart ceiling light with excellent light output. The tunable white feature is perfect for our kitchen, allowing bright task lighting when cooking and softer ambient light for dining. Installation was easy enough for a DIY-er with basic electrical knowledge. My only critique is that occasionally there's a slight delay between using the app and the light responding - not a major issue but noticeable. The circadian rhythm setting has helped my family maintain better sleep patterns by automatically adjusting throughout the day.

3) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After dealing with buzzing, flickering smart bulbs in our ceiling fan, this integrated ceiling light is a massive upgrade. The flush mount design looks sleek, and the light quality is superb. I particularly appreciate the smooth dimming without any flicker, even at the lowest settings. The voice control works flawlessly with our existing smart home setup. The away mode gives us peace of mind when traveling, creating a convincing illusion that someone is home by mimicking our typical usage patterns.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As an interior designer, I've installed these in several client homes with fantastic feedback. The color temperature range is excellent - the warmest setting is truly warm (not that odd yellowish some LEDs produce), and the coolest is a clean daylight that doesn't skew blue. The light distribution through the diffuser is perfectly even, eliminating harsh shadows. I appreciate that the fixture itself has a timeless design that complements various decor styles. Energy consumption is impressively low for the light output.

5) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** This light has worked well in our bedroom for six months now. The gradual wake-up lighting feature has been a much more pleasant alarm than traditional sound-based ones. Installation was straightforward, though the included wire nuts were a bit small for my home's thicker wiring - had to use my own. The design is attractive and low-profile, perfect for our 8-foot ceilings. Only giving 4 stars because the app occasionally loses connection after internet outages and requires resetting the light to reconnect.

## FAQ
1) Is the Whisker Ceiling Light compatible with standard wall switches and dimmers?
   The Whisker Ceiling Light works with standard on/off wall switches but is NOT compatible with traditional wall dimmers. The light must receive full power to maintain its smart functionality. When using a standard wall switch, keep it in the "on" position and control dimming through the Meowtica app or voice commands. If the wall switch is turned off, the light will lose Wi-Fi connection until power is restored. For homes with multiple switches controlling one fixture (like three-way switches), special installation considerations apply - please consult our online installation guide or contact customer support for detailed instructions.

2) How does the circadian rhythm lighting feature work?
   The circadian rhythm feature automatically adjusts your light's color temperature and brightness throughout the day to mimic natural sunlight patterns, supporting your body's internal clock. When enabled, the light will shift from a warm, gentle glow in early morning (about 2700K), transitioning to energizing bright daylight (5000K-6500K) during midday hours, then gradually returning to warmer tones (3000K) in the evening, and finally a very warm, reduced brightness setting (2200K) before bedtime. You can customize the schedule to match your personal routine in the Meowtica app under Settings > Light Options > Circadian Rhythm. This feature works best when used consistently and can help improve sleep quality and daytime alertness.

3) Can I install the Whisker Ceiling Light in a bathroom or outdoor covered porch?
   The Whisker Ceiling Light has a damp-location rating, making it suitable for bathrooms with proper ventilation where it won't be directly exposed to water (avoid installation directly over showers or bathtubs). It is NOT rated for outdoor installation, even in covered areas like porches or patios, as exposure to outdoor humidity, temperature fluctuations, and environmental conditions will damage the electronics and void the warranty. For outdoor applications, please see our dedicated outdoor lighting products like the Meowtica Outdoor Smart Sconce or WeatherGuard Ceiling Light, which are specifically designed with weather-resistant features and appropriate IP ratings for outdoor use.

4) What happens if my Wi-Fi or internet goes down?
   If your Wi-Fi network experiences an outage, the Whisker Ceiling Light will maintain its last state (on/off, brightness level, and color temperature) but will temporarily lose smart functionality like app control and scheduling. Once Wi-Fi is restored, the light will automatically reconnect to your network and resume full functionality without requiring any action on your part. If your internet connection goes down but your local Wi-Fi remains active, many functions will continue to work within your home network. For homes where power or network outages are common, pairing with a Meowtica Smart Hub provides additional reliability through local control capabilities that don't depend on continuous cloud connectivity.

5) Can I replace the LED array when it eventually burns out?
   The Whisker Ceiling Light features an integrated LED design where the light source is engineered as part of the fixture for optimal performance, efficiency, and slim profile. The LEDs are not user-replaceable like traditional bulbs. However, with a rated lifespan of 25,000 hours (over 22 years at 3 hours of daily use), replacement shouldn't be a concern for many years. This design choice allows for better heat management, improved energy efficiency, and more consistent light quality. When the LEDs eventually do reach end-of-life (typically by gradually becoming dimmer rather than failing completely), the entire fixture would need replacement. Our 3-year warranty covers premature LED failure, and we offer upgrade discounts for returning customers.
