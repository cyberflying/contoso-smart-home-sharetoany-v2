   **Review:** Installation was straightforward following the instructions, though I did need to look up a YouTube video for my specific HVAC system. The energy reports are fascinating and have helped me optimize my usage. Only complaint is that the initial setup requires careful attention to instructions.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** The integration with the Meowtica Smart Hub is seamless, and being able to control the temperature with voice commands is incredibly convenient. The temperature sensing is precise, and I appreciate the sleek design that blends with our decor.

5) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Great thermostat overall. Installation was easy even for a non-technical person like me. The learning feature works well, though it took about two weeks to really understand my patterns. I'd give it 5 stars if the app had a few more customization options.
