## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This doorbell has completely transformed our home security! The HD video is crystal clear even at night, and the two-way audio means I can talk to delivery drivers from anywhere. Installation took about 15 minutes, and the app is intuitive and responsive. I particularly love getting alerts when packages are delivered.

2) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After having several packages stolen from my porch, I installed the Meowtica doorbell. Not only has it deterred would-be thieves, but the package detection feature ensures I know exactly when deliveries arrive. The battery lasts about 4 months for me, which is impressive given how busy my front door is!

3) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Very satisfied with this smart doorbell. The video quality is excellent, and I appreciate being able to see visitors before opening the door. The pre-recorded responses are useful when I'm busy but need to respond to someone at the door. The only reason for 4 stars is that occasionally there's a slight delay in notifications.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As someone who travels frequently, this doorbell gives me tremendous peace of mind. I can monitor my front door from anywhere in the world, speak to visitors, and even check that my house-sitter is coming as scheduled. The installation was straightforward, and the weather resistance has been impressive through storms.

5) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** The motion detection is impressively accurate - it distinguishes between people and vehicles, so I don't get unnecessary alerts. The customizable motion zones completely eliminated false alarms from street traffic. The visitor history makes it easy to check if I missed anything while I was busy. Excellent product!

## FAQ
1) Does the Meowtica Smart Doorbell require a monthly subscription?
   While the doorbell functions without a subscription, a cloud service plan is recommended to access features like video history storage beyond 24 hours, clip sharing, and package detection. Local storage options are available when used with the Meowtica Smart Hub.

2) Can I install the doorbell myself, or do I need a professional?
   Most users successfully install the doorbell themselves in 15-20 minutes. Battery installation requires no wiring knowledge. For hardwired installation, basic knowledge of home electrical systems is helpful, though the process is straightforward.

3) Will the doorbell work with my existing chime?
   When hardwired, the doorbell can work with most mechanical and digital chimes. The app includes a compatibility checker and setup instructions for various chime types. Battery-powered installations use the Meowtica app for notifications rather than a physical chime.

4) How long does the battery last between charges?
   Battery life typically ranges from 3-6 months, depending on settings and usage frequency. Higher video quality, frequent motion events, and extreme temperatures can reduce battery life. The app provides advance warning when the battery needs charging.

5) Can I check recordings if someone comes to my door when I'm not connected to the internet?
   If you're using cloud storage, you can view recordings once you regain internet connectivity. If using local storage with the Meowtica Smart Hub, recordings are saved regardless of your internet status and can be accessed when you reconnect to your home network.
