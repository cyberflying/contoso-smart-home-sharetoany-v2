## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** These outdoor smart plugs have transformed our backyard. We installed two units - one for our landscape lighting and another for the patio area. Being able to control everything remotely is fantastic, but the scheduling features are what really make this product shine. Our pathway lights automatically turn on at sunset and off at sunrise, adjusting perfectly with seasonal changes. We've had them installed for over a year through all four seasons (including heavy snow and rainstorms), and they've remained completely reliable. The independent outlet control is perfect for separating permanent lighting from occasional-use items like our outdoor string lights for entertaining.

2) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As someone who goes all-out with holiday decorations, these outdoor plugs are absolute game-changers. I purchased four units to control different zones of my elaborate Christmas light setup, and the ability to coordinate everything through the app saved me from countless trips outside in freezing temperatures. The energy monitoring feature was eye-opening - I had no idea how much electricity my old inflatable decorations were consuming! I particularly appreciate the away mode that creates realistic lighting patterns while we travel for the holidays. Construction quality is excellent, with sturdy weatherproof covers that have held up perfectly despite being installed in exposed locations.

3) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** The PurrFect Outdoor Smart Plug performs extremely well in tough conditions. I'm using it to control my pool equipment and garden irrigation system, and it's survived everything from scorching summer heat to freezing winter temps. The scheduling functionality works flawlessly - my pool pump runs during off-peak electricity hours, saving significantly on our utility bills. My only complaint is that the Wi-Fi range could be better; I had to install a mesh network extender to maintain reliable connectivity to our back garden location. That said, once properly connected, the plugs have operated without issues for over nine months.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** Living in Seattle, weather resistance was my primary concern, and this smart plug has exceeded expectations. It's been mounted under a minimal eave overhang for over a year, experiencing our notorious constant rain without any signs of water ingress or deterioration. The astronomical clock function is particularly useful in our location with dramatically different daylight hours between summer and winter - our patio lighting adjusts automatically throughout the year. Voice control integration with our existing smart home system works seamlessly, and the app interface is intuitive. I appreciate that both outlets can be controlled independently but also grouped when needed.

5) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After burning through two cheaper outdoor smart plugs from other brands, I decided to invest in the PurrFect model, and the difference in quality is immediately apparent. The construction is substantially more robust, with tight-fitting protective covers and quality weather sealing. The mounting options are well-designed, making installation on our deck posts straightforward. Performance has been flawless through several severe thunderstorms. The energy monitoring feature has been surprisingly useful - we discovered our outdoor fountain was using much more electricity than expected, prompting us to run it on a more efficient schedule. Highly recommended for anyone serious about outdoor automation.

## FAQ
1) How weather-resistant is the PurrFect Outdoor Smart Plug?
   The PurrFect Outdoor Smart Plug features an IP65 weather-resistance rating, which provides complete protection against dust ingress and protection against low-pressure water jets from any direction. This means it can withstand heavy rain, snow, heat, humidity, and dust without compromising functionality. The protective covers for each outlet provide additional weather protection when outlets are not in use. For optimal longevity, we recommend installing under an eave, overhang, or covered area whenever possible. While the device is built to withstand outdoor conditions year-round, it's not designed to be submerged in water or placed in locations where standing water collects. In regions with extreme weather conditions (sustained temperatures below -4°F/-20°C or above 122°F/50°C), consider utilizing seasonal storage during off-seasons.

2) Can I control the two outlets independently, and what are the load limitations?
   Yes, the PurrFect Outdoor Smart Plug features two completely independent outlets that can be controlled, scheduled, and monitored separately through the Meowtica app. Each outlet can handle up to 10A/1200W, with a combined maximum load of 15A/1800W across both outlets. This independence allows you to create different automation routines for each connected device – for example, having landscape lighting on a sunset/sunrise schedule while a fountain or holiday decorations follow a different timed pattern. Each outlet has its own physical control button on the device itself in addition to app and voice control options. The system monitors power consumption for each outlet independently, so you can track energy usage for each connected device separately. If you approach maximum load capacity, the app will provide alerts to help prevent circuit overload.

3) How does the sunrise/sunset automation feature work?
   The astronomical clock feature uses your device's location to automatically determine local sunrise and sunset times, allowing connected devices to activate and deactivate based on natural daylight patterns. This functionality adjusts automatically throughout the year as daylight hours change with the seasons – no manual updates required. You can customize the feature by adding offsets (e.g., 30 minutes before sunset or 45 minutes after sunrise) to suit your specific needs. The system accounts for geographical variations in daylight patterns based on your latitude and longitude, ensuring accurate timing even in locations with extreme seasonal daylight differences. Advanced options allow you to create exceptions for specific dates or seasons and to incorporate local weather data, such as adjusting for overcast days when natural light diminishes earlier than typical sunset times.

4) Will the plug remember its settings during a power outage?
   Yes, the PurrFect Outdoor Smart Plug stores all scheduling, automation rules, and outlet settings in non-volatile memory that persists even during power outages. When power is restored, the plug will automatically reconnect to your Wi-Fi network and resume normal operation according to its programmed settings. You can customize how each outlet behaves after a power restoration by selecting whether outlets should return to their previous state, always turn on, or always remain off when power returns – particularly useful for critical applications like pond pumps or security lighting. The energy monitoring system will also mark these interruptions in your usage history to explain any gaps in data. If the power outage affected your Wi-Fi network, the plug will continue trying to reconnect automatically once your router comes back online without requiring any user intervention.

5) How does the outdoor plug integrate with my existing Meowtica smart home devices?
   The PurrFect Outdoor Smart Plug integrates seamlessly with the entire Meowtica ecosystem and compatible third-party platforms. You can include outdoor devices in comprehensive home scenes and routines – for example, a "Good Night" routine could turn off both indoor lights and outdoor landscape lighting, or a "Movie Night" scene could dim indoor lights while activating outdoor patio lighting. The plug works with Meowtica Sensors for trigger-based automation, such as activating security lighting when motion is detected or turning on a water feature when outdoor temperature reaches a certain threshold. It's compatible with the Meowtica app's geofencing feature, allowing outdoor lighting to activate automatically when you arrive home after dark. Voice control works with Meowtica's own assistant as well as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, providing consistent control across your entire smart home environment regardless of device location.
