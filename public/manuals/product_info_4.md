## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** The video quality on this camera is outstanding! I can see everything clearly even at night, and the app notifications are prompt whenever motion is detected. I installed it above my front door, and the weather-resistant design has held up perfectly through rain and snow.

2) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Setup was straightforward and the two-way audio is crystal clear. I use it to check on my pets while I'm at work and can even talk to them. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I wish the cloud storage free tier offered more than 24 hours of recording history.

3) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This camera has already proven its worth! Last week it caught someone trying to open my car door in the driveway. The motion alerts came through instantly, and the night vision was clear enough to identify the person. The wide-angle lens covers my entire driveway perfectly.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After trying several security cameras, the Meowtica is by far my favorite. The activity zones feature eliminates false alerts from my busy street while still catching anyone who comes up the walkway. Installation took less than 10 minutes, and the app is intuitive and reliable.

5) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Great camera with excellent image quality. I particularly appreciate the physical privacy cover option when we're home. The only minor issue I've had is occasional delays in notifications when my WiFi signal is weaker, but that's more a network issue than a camera problem.

## FAQ
1) Does the Meowtica Security Camera require a monthly subscription?
   While the camera functions without a subscription and includes 24 hours of cloud storage for free, extended cloud storage options require a monthly subscription. Alternatively, you can use a microSD card for local recording without any subscription fees.

2) Can I use this camera outdoors?
   Yes, the Meowtica Security Camera is IP65 rated, making it resistant to dust and water jets from any direction. It's suitable for outdoor use in most weather conditions but should be installed in a somewhat sheltered location when possible.

   You can add an unlimited number of Meowtica cameras to a single account. All cameras will be accessible through the same app interface.

4) Does the camera work if my internet goes down?
   If using local storage with a microSD card, the camera will continue to record even without internet connectivity. However, live viewing and notifications require an internet connection.

   Yes, the Meowtica app allows you to share camera access with family members or trusted individuals. You can set different permission levels for each shared user.
