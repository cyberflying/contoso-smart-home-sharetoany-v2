- Place the sensor with the sensing disc in direct contact with the floor or surface
- Ensure the area is clean and flat for optimal contact
- For raised appliances, consider placing the sensor where water would flow if a leak occurred

#### Step 5: Test the Sensor

- Pour a small amount of water onto a surface (not directly on the sensor)
- Slide the sensor into contact with the water
- Verify that the alarm sounds and a notification is sent to your smartphone
- Dry the sensor completely after testing

### Using Your Water Sensor

#### Monitoring Water Leaks

- The sensor automatically monitors for water 24/7
- When water is detected, the sensor will:
  1. Sound an 85dB alarm
  2. Send an immediate notification to your smartphone
  3. Record the event in the activity history
  4. Trigger any automations you've set up

#### Creating Automations

Use your water sensor to trigger responses from other smart devices:

1. In the Meowtica app, go to "Automations"
2. Select "Create New Automation"
3. Choose your water sensor as the trigger
4. Select actions such as:
   - Turn off water supply (requires compatible smart water valve)
   - Turn on lights
   - Send notifications to family members
   - Sound alarms on smart speakers
5. Save your automation

#### Checking Sensor Status

- In the Meowtica app, select your water sensor
- View the current status (monitoring, water detected, offline)
- Check battery level
- View temperature readings
- Access the activity history

### Maintenance and Troubleshooting

#### Regular Maintenance

- Test the sensor monthly by following the testing instructions
- Clean the sensing disc occasionally with a dry cloth
- Check battery status in the app and replace when indicated
- Ensure the sensor remains properly positioned in high-risk areas

#### Battery Replacement

1. When you receive a low battery notification, prepare to replace the batteries
2. Remove the sensor from its location
3. Twist the top housing counterclockwise to open
4. Remove the old AAA batteries
5. Insert new AAA batteries, observing correct polarity
6. Reattach the top housing by twisting clockwise
7. Test the sensor to ensure proper operation

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**No Notifications**
- Verify the sensor is within range of your Smart Hub
- Check your smartphone notification settings
- Ensure the Meowtica app is running in the background
- Check battery level in the app

**False Alarms**
- Clean the sensing disc and surrounding area
- Ensure the sensor is on a flat, dry surface
- Check for condensation in high-humidity areas
- Move the sensor away from potential splash zones

**Connectivity Issues**
- Verify that your Smart Hub is online
- Move the sensor closer to the hub if possible
- Reset the sensor by removing and reinserting batteries

## Cautions
1. **Not Waterproof**: While the sensing disc is water-resistant, do not submerge the entire unit in water.
2. **Battery Handling**: Follow proper battery disposal guidelines when replacing batteries.
3. **Not a Prevention Device**: The sensor detects but does not prevent water leaks; regular maintenance of appliances and plumbing is still necessary.
4. **Not for Flammable Liquids**: Use only to detect water; not suitable for detecting other liquids.
5. **Proper Placement**: Ensure the sensor is placed where water would naturally flow in case of a leak.
6. **Regular Testing**: Test the sensor periodically to ensure proper operation.
7. **Temperature Limitations**: Do not use in environments outside the specified temperature range.
8. **No Disassembly**: Do not attempt to open or repair the sensor beyond battery replacement.
9. **Clean Properly**: Use only a dry cloth to clean the sensor; avoid cleaning solutions.
10. **Keep Accessible**: Place the sensor where the alarm can be heard and the unit can be accessed for maintenance.

## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This little device saved my basement from serious water damage! My water heater started leaking in the middle of the night, but the PurrFect sensor caught it immediately and the alarm woke me up. The app notification showed exactly what was happening and I was able to shut off the water before any major damage occurred. Worth every penny!

2) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Very reliable sensor with quick alerts. I've placed these under sinks and near my washing machine. Setup was simple and the battery life seems excellent so far (6 months and still at 90%). The only improvement I could suggest would be a slightly larger contact area for the water detection.

3) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After experiencing a costly leak from our dishwasher while on vacation, we installed these sensors throughout our home. The peace of mind is incredible, knowing we'll get instant alerts if anything goes wrong. The loud local alarm is a great feature too, in case neighbors need to hear it when we're away.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** I'm extremely impressed with how sensitive yet accurate this sensor is. It detected a very slow leak under my kitchen sink that I might not have noticed for weeks. The automation feature is fantastic - I've set it up to flash our smart lights if water is detected when we're home.

5) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Great product that does exactly what it promises. Easy to set up and the notifications are prompt. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it had a slightly longer-range wireless connection, as I needed to add a hub extender to reach my basement. Otherwise, excellent quality and performance!

## FAQ
1) Will the PurrFect Water Sensor detect slow leaks or just standing water?
   The sensor detects any water that makes contact with the sensing disc, including slow leaks that accumulate under the sensor. However, it cannot detect moisture within walls or pipes before it reaches the sensor.

2) Can the PurrFect Water Sensor work without the Meowtica Smart Hub?
   No, the PurrFect Water Sensor requires connection to a Meowtica Smart Hub to enable smartphone notifications and smart home integrations. However, the local alarm will function even without connectivity.

3) How loud is the alarm, and can it be silenced remotely?
   The alarm is 85dB, approximately as loud as a busy street or blender. It can be silenced remotely through the Meowtica app once you've been notified of the leak.

4) How will I know when to replace the batteries?
   You'll receive a notification through the Meowtica app when the batteries are running low. The sensor also features an LED indicator that will flash when batteries need replacement.

5) Can I place the sensor in areas that occasionally get wet, like a bathroom floor?
   While possible, this may result in false alarms. The sensor is best placed in areas that should remain dry under normal circumstances, such as under sinks, behind toilets, or near appliances like washing machines and water heaters.
