## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This outdoor camera has been outstanding for monitoring our property. The 2K resolution is remarkably clear - we can easily make out faces and license plate numbers even at night with the color night vision. The AI detection is impressively accurate, distinguishing between people, vehicles, and animals so we only get alerts that matter. Battery life has exceeded expectations, lasting about 5 months before needing a recharge. Installation was straightforward and the app is intuitive.

2) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After trying several outdoor security cameras, the Meowtica is by far the best. The spotlight feature has been a game changer - it illuminates our entire driveway when motion is detected and has deterred several potential trespassers. The two-way audio is clear even in windy conditions, and I love being able to speak to delivery drivers without opening the door. The weatherproofing is excellent - it's survived torrential rain and snow without issues.

3) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Great camera with exceptional video quality. The AI detection is much more accurate than my previous camera - no more alerts every time a leaf blows by. The siren is surprisingly loud and effective. I only took off one star because the initial setup was a bit tricky with my mesh Wi-Fi system, but once connected it's been rock solid. Battery life is good but drops faster in very cold weather - I'm considering the solar panel accessory.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As someone living in a rural area, this camera provides incredible peace of mind. The night vision range is impressive and covers my entire driveway. The built-in spotlight is bright enough to startle anyone approaching. I particularly appreciate the local storage option, so footage is available even if internet goes down. The motion zones are precisely customizable, allowing me to ignore my neighbor's property while monitoring my own.

5) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** I'm a professional security installer and have started recommending these cameras to all my clients. The build quality is exceptional, and the image clarity beats cameras costing twice as much. The app gives users granular control over every setting while remaining user-friendly. I really appreciate the dual storage options and the fact that it works as a standalone device or integrates seamlessly with other Meowtica products. Mounting is secure and the adjustment range is excellent.

## FAQ
1) How does the AI detection feature work to reduce false alerts?
   The Meowtica Outdoor Camera uses advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze motion events in real-time. It can distinguish between people, vehicles, animals, and environmental motion (like rain, shadows, or foliage movement). You can customize which types of detection trigger notifications, allowing you to receive alerts only for relevant activity. For example, you can choose to be notified when a person approaches your door but not when a squirrel runs through your yard or when trees sway in the wind.

2) What are my storage options, and do I need a subscription?
   The camera offers flexible storage options to meet different needs. Local storage is available via a microSD card (up to 256GB, sold separately) which provides continuous recording without subscription fees. The camera also includes free cloud storage for 24 hours of event-based recordings. For extended cloud storage, subscription plans are available: Standard Plan ($4.99/month) provides 30 days of cloud storage, while Premium Plan ($9.99/month) extends to 60 days and includes additional features like person recognition and package detection.

3) How long does the battery last, and what affects battery life?
   With typical use (15-20 events per day), the battery lasts approximately 4-6 months on a single charge. Several factors affect battery life: higher recording resolution, longer recording duration, increased motion detection events, frequent live viewing, colder temperatures, and extensive use of the spotlight or two-way audio. For areas with high activity, we recommend either the hardwired installation option or purchasing the compatible Meowtica Solar Panel accessory, which can keep the battery charged indefinitely with adequate sunlight.

4) Can I use this camera without a Meowtica Smart Hub?
   Yes, the Meowtica Outdoor Camera functions completely as a standalone device and connects directly to your Wi-Fi network without requiring a hub. However, integrating with a Meowtica Smart Hub enables additional features including extended wireless range, local video processing for faster notifications, continuous recording options, direct integration with other Meowtica devices, and backup connectivity during internet outages. The camera works with any Meowtica hub model, including the flagship Smart Hub, Paws Mini, or WhiskerNet Pro.

5) How secure is my camera footage?
   We prioritize security at every level. Video is encrypted using AES-256 encryption during transmission and storage, whether saved locally or in the cloud. Your account is protected with two-factor authentication, and you have complete control over who can access your camera. We do not sell or share your footage, and our cloud infrastructure undergoes regular security audits and compliance certifications. The camera also features tamper detection - if someone attempts to remove or disable the camera, you'll receive an immediate alert.
