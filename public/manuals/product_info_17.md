## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As a smart home installer for high-end homes, the WhiskerNet Pro Hub has become my go-to controller. The range is exceptional - I've successfully connected devices across a 6,000 sq ft home without needing extenders. The Matter compatibility ensures future-proofing for my clients, and the local processing means automations execute instantly. The backup battery has saved several clients during power outages, maintaining critical security and lighting systems. Worth every penny for serious smart home users.

2) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** After struggling with connectivity issues using lesser hubs, the WhiskerNet Pro has been rock solid. The multi-protocol support allowed me to integrate all my existing devices regardless of brand or standard. I was particularly impressed with the migration tool that transferred all my automations from my old system. The security features give me peace of mind, especially the automatic security updates and encryption. Excellent product for those with complex smart home setups.

3) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** The WhiskerNet Pro Hub eliminated all the dead zones in my three-story home. I now have over 150 connected devices running smoothly with zero latency issues. The Pro Automation Builder is incredibly powerful - I've created custom sequences that would be impossible on other platforms. My favorite feature is the ability to process critical automations locally, so my security system and emergency lighting continue functioning even during internet outages. Expensive but absolutely worth it.

4) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** This hub delivers impressive performance and range as promised. Setting up my extensive Z-Wave network was seamless, and the automatic protocol detection made adding new devices much simpler than with my previous hub. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the learning curve for the Pro Automation Builder - while powerful, it's not particularly intuitive for non-technical users. That said, once you master it, the automation capabilities are unmatched in the industry.

5) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As someone who values both privacy and reliability, the WhiskerNet Pro Hub has exceeded my expectations. The local processing means my sensitive data stays in my home, not in the cloud. The multi-network capability has been crucial during internet outages - my critical systems automatically switch to cellular backup. The enterprise-grade security features are exceptional, with detailed logs that help me monitor for any unusual activity. Highly recommended for privacy-conscious users with complex smart home needs.
