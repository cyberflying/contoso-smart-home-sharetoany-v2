## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This motion sensor is incredible! The pet-friendly detection really works - my cat can roam freely without setting off false alarms, but it still detects any human movement instantly. The 18-month battery life is a huge plus, and I love how quickly I get notifications on my phone.

2) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Great detection range and sensitivity. I've placed these throughout my home and they work seamlessly with my Meowtica system. Only giving 4 stars because I wish the detection angle was slightly wider for larger rooms, but otherwise perfect!

3) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** Super easy setup - took less than 5 minutes to get working with my Smart Hub. The night vision capability gives me peace of mind, and the mounting options made it easy to find the perfect spot in each room. Highly recommended!

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** The customizable sensitivity settings are a game-changer! I was able to fine-tune it perfectly for my space, and the temperature sensor is an unexpected but useful bonus feature. Very happy with this purchase and the battery life seems to be holding up as advertised.

5) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Reliable motion detection with quick notifications. I've had mine for about 6 months with no issues. The pet detection works most of the time, though occasionally my large dog will trigger it. Overall very satisfied with the performance.
